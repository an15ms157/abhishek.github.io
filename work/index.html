	<h3>My work</h3>
	<p> I work in the domain of high energy Physics. I am a part of the ALICE collaboration at CERN. My principal interest lies in detector simulation 
		and development. Currently I am working on to develop a new silicon detector for run5 in ALICE which aims to detect low energetic photons.  </p>
