  Hi there, I'm Abhishek Nath!</p>
	I'm currently doing my PhD from HighRR group, KIP, Heidelberg University. When I am not working, I binge watch movies a lot, code (<em> only when I get bored of movies </em>) and
	    obscurely plan to make a self-financed movie one day. My idea to start a github+Jekyll driven static website originated simply because
I wish to learn more about version control and polish my skills on coding but in an interesting way. <a href="/about">Read more about myself...</a>
