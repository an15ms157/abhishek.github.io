	<h1>Physics grad student, movie enthusiast and coder says hi!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently doing my PhD from HighRR group, KIP, Heidelberg University. I binge watch movies a lot, code ( <em> only when I get bored of movies </em>) and
		obscurely plan to make a self financed movie one day. My idea to start a website via github is simply driven from the fact that I wish to learn more about 
		version control and polish my skills on coding on the way. <a href="/about">Read more about myself...</a></p>
